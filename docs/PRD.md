# Executive Summary

Amplifi is an AI-powered creative director that analyzes a brand and produces complete, ready-to-post social media content packages — captions, images, hashtags, and posting schedules — all generated together in a single interleaved output stream. Built for the Gemini Live Agent Challenge hackathon ($80K prize pool, Google DeepMind / Devpost).

The key innovation: copy and visuals are born together. Unlike every existing tool that generates text and images separately, Amplifi uses Gemini's interleaved output to produce captions and matching product images in one coherent stream. This directly matches the Creative Storyteller category's core requirement and two of the example use cases listed in the rules (marketing asset generator, social media content creator).

Built on Gemini 2.5 Flash, Google ADK, and Google Cloud.

# Problem Statement

Small businesses face a content creation bottleneck that directly impacts their growth:

1. **Volume demands:** Maintaining a presence across Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and X requires 4–7 posts per platform per week — that's 20–30+ pieces of content weekly. Most small business owners simply can't keep up.
2. **Fragmented tooling:** Existing tools force owners to context-switch between 3–5 separate products: Jasper for copy, Canva for images, Hootsuite for scheduling, ChatGPT for ideas. Each tool produces isolated outputs that must be manually stitched together.
3. **Disconnected AI outputs:** No tool generates copy and visuals together. A caption written by one AI and an image generated by another feel generic and mismatched. There's no creative coherence — the text says "warm and inviting" but the image is cold and sterile.
4. **Cost barrier:** Enterprise tools (Hootsuite at $99+/mo, Jasper at $49+/mo) are priced for marketing teams, not solo operators. Small businesses need agency-quality output at DIY prices.

# Solution

Amplifi is an AI creative director that analyzes your brand and produces complete social media content packages — captions, images, hashtags, and posting schedules — all generated together in a single interleaved output stream. The copy and visuals are born together, ensuring every post feels cohesive and on-brand.

## Core Experience

- **Brand-first intelligence:** Upload your website URL or product photos. Amplifi's Brand Analyst agent builds a complete brand profile — colors, tone, target audience, competitive positioning — that informs every piece of content it creates. No more generic AI outputs.
- **Interleaved content generation:** Watch as captions and matching images stream together in real-time. Monday's post appears with its custom product photo, then Tuesday's story graphic — all flowing as one cohesive output. This is Gemini's interleaved output in action.
- **Full content packages:** Not individual assets but complete weekly content plans. Each post includes caption + product/lifestyle image + 5–8 relevant hashtags + optimal posting time + platform-specific formatting notes.
- **Multi-agent quality pipeline:** Four specialized agents work in sequence — Brand Analyst, Strategist, Content Creator, Reviewer — ensuring every post passes brand consistency checks before delivery.

## What Makes This Different

The Creative Storyteller category specifically asks for projects that "leverage Gemini's interleaved text and image output." Amplifi doesn't just use interleaved output as a feature — it IS the product. The entire value proposition depends on text and images being generated together:

- Captions reference visual elements that are simultaneously being created
- Images reflect the mood, tone, and messaging of the accompanying copy
- Brand colors, typography style, and aesthetic carry across both text and visuals
- A week's worth of content maintains visual and tonal consistency because it's generated in one contextual session
- For video-first platforms (Reels, TikTok, Stories), the interleaved hero image becomes the first frame of a Veo-generated video clip — ensuring the static post and the video clip share the same visual DNA

# User Flow

| Step | What Happens | User Experience |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Onboarding** | User enters their website URL and describes their business in free text (min 20 characters). Alternatively, users without a website can toggle to description-only mode, where the free-text description becomes the primary input. Optionally uploads brand assets (photos, PDFs like brand guides or menus) to enrich the analysis. | Two modes: (a) URL + description + optional uploads → "Analyze My Brand," (b) No-website toggle → description-only + optional uploads → "Build My Brand Profile." Toggle is reversible. Brand asset upload zone accepts images and PDFs (max 3 files), clearly marked as optional. Analysis steps adapt based on mode (URL crawling vs description inference). Takes under 2 minutes. |
| **2. Brand Analysis** | Brand Analyst Agent scrapes the website, analyzes uploaded assets, and extracts brand colors, tone of voice, target audience, competitive positioning, and content themes. Analysis is weighted by business type — personal brands emphasize thought leadership; local businesses emphasize community and product. | Brand profile card appears with all extracted attributes. User can edit any field to correct or refine. |
| **3. Strategy** | Strategy Agent takes the brand profile + user's goals (e.g., "launch spring menu") + optional business events this week (e.g., "new croissant Tuesday, farmer's market Saturday") and generates a 7-day content calendar. P1: identifies 1–2 pillar ideas per week and plans platform-specific derivatives. Real business events become pillar anchors automatically. | Interactive calendar view showing each day's planned content theme and platform. "What's happening this week?" text area above calendar. Pillar posts are visually grouped. User can drag-and-drop to rearrange. |
| **4. Photo Upload (P1)** | For any calendar day, user can optionally drop their own photo (iPhone shot, product photo, team pic). Days with user photos use image understanding; days without use image generation. | "Drop photo here" zone on each day card. Uploading a photo switches that day from "AI generates image" to "AI writes for your image." |
| **5. Generation** | Content Creator Agent produces posts using Gemini's interleaved output. For days without a user photo: generates caption + matching image + hashtags in one stream. For days with a user photo: generates caption + hashtags crafted specifically for that image. For video-eligible days (Reels, Stories, TikTok): optional "Generate Video" button creates an 8-sec Veo clip using the hero image as first frame. On text-first platforms (LinkedIn, X, Facebook), the video section is collapsed by default into a minimal pill — expandable on click — to reduce visual noise for text-primary creators. | Real-time generation stream: text appears, then its matching image materializes (or user photo is displayed), then hashtags. Video generation is a separate async action with a progress bar. Text-first platforms show a collapsed "Video Clip (not typical for this platform)" pill instead of the full video section. |
| **6. Review** | Review Agent automatically checks each generated post against the brand profile for consistency (tone, colors, messaging) and platform rules (character limits, hashtag counts). | Green checkmarks on passing posts, yellow flags on posts needing revision. Click a flag to see specific feedback. |
| **7. Export** | User approves posts and exports via clipboard (primary), individual download, or full ZIP. "Copy All" button copies all filtered captions as a structured clipboard string with per-post headers and separators. Per-post copy and image download are also available. Full calendar export as ZIP. | Clipboard-first: "Copy All" in the post library header copies all captions for pasting into scheduling tools. Per-post "Copy" button for individual captions. Per-post image download via signed URL. Full calendar export as ZIP. |

# Technical Architecture

## Agent Design (Google ADK)

| Agent | Model | Input | Output | Key Tools |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Brand Analyst** | gemini-2.5-flash | Website URL (optional), free-text business description, uploaded assets (images/PDFs) | Brand profile document: colors, tone, audience, positioning, content themes, inferred business type | `fetch_website`, `analyze_brand_colors`, `extract_brand_voice`, `scan_competitors`, `process_uploaded_assets` |
| **Strategy Agent** | gemini-2.5-flash | Brand profile + user goals + platform selection | 7-day content calendar with themes, platforms, and timing per day | `generate_calendar`, `research_trending_hashtags`, `analyze_best_posting_times` |
| **Content Creator** ⭐ | gemini-2.5-flash with `responseModalities: ["TEXT", "IMAGE"]` | Brand profile + single day's content brief from calendar | Interleaved stream: caption text + generated product image + hashtags + posting notes | Gemini interleaved output (no custom tools — the model itself generates both text and images) |
| **Review Agent** | gemini-2.5-flash (text only) | Generated content + brand profile | Approved/flagged status with specific revision suggestions | `check_brand_consistency`, `validate_hashtags`, `check_platform_rules` |

### Agent Orchestration

The four agents run as a **SequentialAgent** pipeline in ADK:

```
Brand Analyst → Strategy Agent → Content Creator (×7 days) → Review Agent
```

The Content Creator is called once per calendar day, producing one post per invocation. The Review Agent evaluates each post individually against the brand profile.

## Interleaved Output — The Star Feature

The Content Creator Agent uses Gemini's `responseModalities: ["TEXT", "IMAGE"]` to generate captions and matching product images in a single API call. This is the core differentiator.

**How it works:**
- The model receives the brand profile (colors, tone, audience) and a daily content brief ("Tuesday: showcase spring pastries, warm and inviting tone")
- It generates caption text, then inline generates a matching product/lifestyle image, then adds hashtags and posting notes — all in one response
- The response contains interleaved `text` and `inline_data` (image bytes) parts that stream to the frontend progressively

**Supported models:**
- `gemini-2.5-flash` with `responseModalities: ["TEXT", "IMAGE"]` (primary)
- `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` for highest quality image gen (fallback)
- Note: `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` has been shut down — do not use

**Pricing:** ~$0.039 per generated image (1,290 tokens at $30/1M output tokens). With the $100 Google Cloud credit, that's ~2,500 generated images — more than sufficient for development + demo + buffer.

## Infrastructure

| Service | Role | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| **Cloud Run** | Backend API + ADK agents | Serverless, auto-scaling. REST API + SSE for streaming interleaved output to the frontend. |
| **Cloud Firestore** | Brand profiles, content plans, post history | Real-time data sync. Generous free tier (1 GiB). Hierarchical data model maps cleanly to brand→plan→day→post. |
| **Cloud Storage** | Generated images, uploaded brand assets | Store/serve generated product images with signed URLs. Upload and store user's logo and product photos. |
| **Cloud Build + Terraform** | CI/CD pipeline + IaC | Automated deployment for bonus points (+0.2). Push to main auto-deploys to Cloud Run. |

# MVP Scope (3-Week Timeline)

| Feature | Priority | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Brand analysis from URL | **P0 — Must Have** | Scrape website, extract brand colors/tone/audience/positioning via Brand Analyst agent. |
| Content calendar generation | **P0 — Must Have** | Strategy Agent produces 7-day plan with themes, platforms, optimal timing per day. |
| Interleaved post generation | **P0 — Must Have** | Content Creator generates caption + matching image + hashtags in single interleaved stream. |
| Brand consistency review | **P0 — Must Have** | Review Agent auto-checks generated content against brand profile. Flags inconsistencies. |
| React dashboard | **P0 — Must Have** | Brand wizard + calendar view + generation view + post library. Mobile responsive. |
| Image storage (Cloud Storage) | **P0 — Must Have** | Store generated images with signed URLs. Serve to frontend for display and download. |
| Streaming UI (SSE) | **P0 — Must Have** | Progressive display of interleaved output — text appears, then image materializes, then hashtags. |
| Voice brand coaching | **P1 — Should Have** | Optional Live API voice mode: AI explains content strategy verbally, coaches through brand positioning. |
| Video generation for Reels/TikTok | **P1 — Should Have** | For calendar days targeting Reels, Stories, or TikTok, generate an 8-second video clip via Veo 3.1. Uses the interleaved-output hero image as the first frame for visual continuity. Async generation with polling — separate "Generate Video" button per day card, not part of the main SSE stream. Supports 9:16 (portrait) for mobile-first platforms and 16:9 (landscape) for YouTube/LinkedIn. Stored as MP4 in Cloud Storage alongside the hero image. Budget-conscious: uses Veo 3.1 Fast ($0.15/sec = ~$1.20 per 8-sec clip) by default, with Standard ($0.40/sec) as an optional quality upgrade. On text-first platforms (LinkedIn, X, Facebook), the video section defaults to a collapsed pill to reduce visual noise — expandable on click if the user wants video for that platform. |
| Bring Your Own Photos mode | **P1 — Should Have** | Users upload their own photos for specific calendar days. The Content Creator Agent switches from "generate caption + image" to "generate caption + hashtags + strategy FOR this photo" using Gemini's image understanding. AI-generated images remain the fallback for days without a user photo. This is critical for small businesses where customers expect real product/location photos. The Brand Wizard gains a bulk photo upload step; the calendar gains a "drop photo here" zone per day card. Architecturally minimal: same Content Creator Agent, different prompt path based on whether `uploaded_photo` is present. |
| Content repurposing (pillar → derivatives) | **P1 — Should Have** | Instead of 7 independent posts, the Strategy Agent generates 1–2 pillar content ideas per week and plans platform-specific derivatives. Example: Monday = LinkedIn long-form post about pricing strategy. Tuesday = X thread (same idea, condensed). Wednesday = Instagram carousel (same idea, visual tips). Each derivative links back to a `pillar_id` in the calendar schema. This is how successful solopreneurs actually operate and produces more coherent weekly content than unrelated daily posts. Implementation is primarily a Strategy Agent prompt change + a `pillar_id` field on day objects. |
| Business description onboarding | **P1 — Should Have** | Free-text business description (min 20 characters) replaces rigid business type selector. User describes their business naturally ("I run a mobile dog grooming van in Austin, I specialize in anxious rescue dogs"). The Brand Analyst infers business type, audience, tone, and content opportunities from the description. No-website toggle provides an alternative path where description + optional brand asset uploads are the only inputs — no URL required. Brand asset upload zone accepts up to 3 files (images, PDFs like brand guides or menus) that are processed multimodally to enrich the brand profile. |
| Landing page | **P1 — Should Have** | Marketing page: hero with gradient headline ("Your entire week of content. One click."), product preview showing mini calendar, 3-step how-it-works, 2×3 feature grid, testimonial placeholder, CTA footer. Desktop-first, clean creative studio aesthetic. CTA flows to onboarding. |
| Event-aware calendar | **P1 — Should Have** | Optional "What's happening this week?" free-text field displayed BETWEEN the Brand Profile screen and the Calendar generation screen (or as a prominent input at the top of the Calendar screen before generation starts). User types real business events: "launching lavender croissant Tuesday, farmer's market booth Saturday, staff birthday Wednesday." The Strategy Agent incorporates these events into the content plan — one pillar becomes the product launch, derivatives flow from there. Events appear as badges on the calendar (e.g., "📅 Event: Valentine's prix fixe (Tue)"). This is the difference between a generic AI calendar and one that feels like it was made by someone who works at the business. Zero new infrastructure: one text input, one prompt parameter (`business_events_this_week`) injected into the Strategy Agent. The UI entry point must be discoverable — users need to understand WHERE events come from when they see badges on the calendar. |
| Visual identity seed | **P1 — Should Have** | During brand analysis, the Brand Analyst generates a persistent "image style directive" — a 2-3 sentence visual identity fragment (e.g., "warm earth tones, soft natural lighting, minimalist composition with generous whitespace, serif typography aesthetic"). This directive is prepended to EVERY Content Creator image generation call for that brand, ensuring stylistic coherence across independently generated images. Not perfect grid consistency (that's P2), but a massive improvement over completely uncoordinated generations. One new field on brand profile: `image_style_directive`. Costs nothing extra — pure prompt engineering. |
| Caption style directive | **P1 — Should Have** | The textual equivalent of the visual identity seed. During brand analysis, the Brand Analyst generates a persistent "caption style directive" — a 2-4 sentence writing rhythm guide (e.g., "Open with a one-sentence hook under 10 words. Use personal anecdotes as the second beat. Deliver the counterintuitive insight by paragraph three. End with a direct question. Prefer em dashes. Never use exclamation marks."). This directive is prepended to EVERY Content Creator caption generation call. Ensures every post sounds like the same person wrote it, even across different platforms and pillar derivatives. One new field on brand profile: `caption_style_directive`. Same architecture as image_style_directive — Brand Analyst generates it, user can edit it, Content Creator consumes it. |
| Engagement prediction scoring | **P2 — Nice to Have** | Replace or supplement the Review Agent's brand consistency checks with engagement prediction. Score posts on likely engagement (1–10) based on platform-specific signals: hook strength, emotional resonance, call-to-action clarity, trending topic alignment. Would require historical engagement data or few-shot examples to calibrate. More valuable than brand-color checking for solopreneurs who care about reach, not visual polish. |
| Existing social media voice analysis | **P2 — Nice to Have** | "Learn my voice from my last 50 posts" — ingest a user's existing LinkedIn, X, or Instagram content to build a more accurate brand voice profile than website scraping alone. The website version of most solopreneurs is polished and corporate; their social media voice is casual and opinionated. Requires social media API integrations (LinkedIn API, X API) with OAuth flows, rate limits, and approval processes. High value but weeks of integration work. The frontend includes an OAuth-ready Social Connect UI with per-platform cards and built-in per-platform demo voice data — LinkedIn (authoritative B2B, no emoji, long-form), Instagram (warm artisanal lifestyle), X (punchy hot-take, short-form) — so users can preview the voice analysis workflow without connecting a real account. |
| Platform meta intelligence | **P2 — Nice to Have** | Dynamic, data-driven understanding of what content formats perform best on each platform right now. "LinkedIn rewards personal stories on Tuesday mornings" changes every quarter and varies by niche. Would require a data pipeline analyzing trending content patterns per platform, updated regularly. Current Strategy Agent uses static best practices; this would make recommendations dynamic and seasonally aware. |
| Video repurposing / smart editing | **P2 — Nice to Have** | User uploads raw video (up to 5 minutes, .mp4/.mov) and Amplifi automatically produces platform-ready short-form clips. **User flow:** (1) User uploads a raw video from Content Detail or Calendar screen via "Upload your video" button alongside the existing BYOP photo upload. (2) AI analyzes the video: speech-to-text transcription, speaker identification, topic segmentation, engagement-peak detection (moments with emphasis, laughter, key statements). (3) AI proposes 2–3 clip options with timestamps, each optimized for a different platform — a 15-second hook for Reels/TikTok, a 30-second highlight for LinkedIn, a 60-second version for YouTube Shorts. (4) User previews clips with auto-generated captions overlay, selects/edits, and exports. **Processing pipeline:** Gemini handles transcription + content analysis (which moments are most compelling). Clip extraction uses FFmpeg server-side. Caption overlay uses a simple text rendering layer. Platform formatting (aspect ratio, duration limits) is rule-based per platform. **Agent design:** New `VideoEditor` agent in the SequentialAgent pipeline, activated only when user uploads raw video. Sits after Content Creator, uses the brand profile's tone and style to write caption overlays that match the brand voice. The `content_type` field on calendar days already distinguishes "reel" from "photo" — a "user_video" type triggers this path. **Key differentiator from Veo (P1):** Veo generates synthetic video from scratch. Video repurposing takes the user's authentic footage and makes it platform-ready. For solopreneurs recording face-to-camera content, this is often more valuable than synthetic video because authenticity drives engagement. **Input constraints:** Max 5 minutes, max 500MB, .mp4 or .mov. Server-side processing via Cloud Run job (not in the request path — upload triggers async processing, user gets notified when clips are ready). |
| Instagram grid visual consistency | **P2 — Nice to Have** | Enforce visual coherence across all 7 independently generated images so the Instagram profile grid looks intentional, not chaotic. Current architecture generates each post's image in a separate API call, causing stylistic variance. Solutions include: generating a "style reference image" first and passing it as context to subsequent generations, or post-processing generated images through a color/style normalization step. Meaningful for Instagram-heavy brands where grid aesthetics drive follower decisions. |
| Multi-platform formatting | **P2 — Nice to Have** | Auto-resize and reformat generated content for different platform specs (IG square, TikTok vertical, LinkedIn landscape). |
| Content editing/regeneration | **P2 — Nice to Have** | User can request "regenerate image" or "make caption shorter" for individual posts. |
| One-tap caption export | **P2 — Nice to Have** | Copy-to-clipboard button on every caption in the Content Detail and Calendar views. Users (especially restaurant owners and solopreneurs) copy captions directly into Instagram/LinkedIn apps — this is their actual workflow. Also support per-post image download and full-week ZIP export. Without one-tap copy, the export step becomes a friction point that breaks the "20-minute Sunday setup" promise. Includes a "Copy All" bulk clipboard button in the Post Library header that copies all filtered captions as a structured string with per-post headers and `---` separators — one tap to get an entire week of content into the clipboard. Export page subtitle leads with "Copy captions to clipboard" as the primary/fastest export path. |
| Platform preview formatting | **P2 — Nice to Have** | Show a live preview of how each post will appear on its target platform: LinkedIn character count with "see more" fold indicator, Instagram square crop preview, X character limit with truncation warning. Critical for LinkedIn-heavy solopreneurs where the hook above the fold determines engagement. Implementation: platform-specific preview components with real character limits and layout simulation. |
| AI image quality validation | **P2 — Nice to Have** | For industries where AI-generated images are high-risk (food photography, fashion, real estate), show a quality confidence indicator on generated images and prominently surface the BYOP toggle. Bad food photography is worse than no photography. Consider offering "caption-only mode" for users who always provide their own photos. The Brand Analyst should flag industries where BYOP is strongly recommended over AI generation. |
| Competitor visibility toggle | **P2 — Nice to Have** | Some users find competitor data motivating; others find it stressful. Add a show/hide toggle on the competitor section of the Brand Profile. Competitor data is still extracted during analysis (it informs content strategy), but the user-facing display is optional. Default to visible, allow hiding. |
| Description-first onboarding option | **P2 — Nice to Have** | For solopreneur-heavy audiences (coaches, consultants, fractional executives), many users don't have websites. Consider making the business description the primary/default input with "Have a website? Paste it for even better results" as the optional enhancement — inverting the current URL-first flow. A/B test which default converts better. Current flow works for URL-having businesses; inverted flow may convert better for service professionals. |
| Industry-adaptive demo content | **P3 — Future** | During onboarding analysis, personalize the demo/sample content to match the user's inferred industry. A leadership coach should see sample LinkedIn posts about delegation, not farm-to-table captions about parsnips. Requires generating a brief sample post during the Brand Analyst phase and displaying it on the Brand Profile screen as a "preview of what we'll create." Increases trust that the AI understands the user's specific domain. |
| Post analytics dashboard | **P3 — Future** | Track engagement metrics after posting. Would require social media API integrations. |

# Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | What It Does | Limitation | Our Edge |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hootsuite** | Social media management + AI scheduling | Enterprise pricing ($99+/mo). AI features are add-ons, not core. No interleaved generation. | AI-first product. Interleaved output. Free (hackathon). |
| **Jasper AI** | AI copywriting with brand voice training | Text-only output, $49+/mo. Separate image generation via integrations. | Copy + images generated TOGETHER in one stream. |
| **Canva** | Visual design + AI assist | Design-first, not strategy-first. No content calendar generation. No brand analysis from URL. | Full pipeline: analysis → strategy → creation → review. |
| **Predis.ai** | AI social content generator + analytics | Generates posts individually, not as interleaved streams. No brand analysis via URL scraping. | Full week's content in one generation. Interleaved output. |
| **Copy.ai** | Short-form AI content generator | Text-only, no image generation. No visual brand analysis. | Multimodal: text + image together. Brand-aware. |
| **Buffer / SocialBee** | Social scheduling + light AI assist | Scheduling tools with minimal AI capability. No content generation. | AI creative director, not just a scheduler. |

**Key differentiators that no competitor has:**
1. **Interleaved output is the core mechanic** — caption + image generated TOGETHER in one stream, not separately
2. **Image-to-video pipeline** — hero image becomes the first frame of an AI-generated video clip via Veo, ensuring visual continuity between static and video content
3. **Bring Your Own Photos + AI fallback** — upload real product photos and get AI-crafted captions, or let AI generate both when you don't have a photo. No other tool seamlessly blends user photos with AI-generated content in one calendar
4. **Pillar content repurposing** — one idea becomes a LinkedIn post, an X thread, an Instagram carousel, and a TikTok caption. Coherent weekly narrative, not 7 disconnected posts
5. **Event-aware calendar** — tell Amplifi what's actually happening at your business this week and the calendar builds around real events, not generic themes
6. **Visual + textual identity seeds** — every generated image shares a consistent brand aesthetic AND every caption follows the same writing rhythm, because the Brand Analyst creates persistent style directives for both
7. **Full content packages** — a week's worth of posts in one generation, not individual assets
8. **Brand analysis from URL** — paste your website, AI builds your brand profile automatically
9. **AI creative director pipeline** — strategy + creation + review in one automated workflow
10. **Built on Gemini's native interleaved output + Veo** — the category literally asks for these capabilities

# Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Image generation takes several seconds | High | Medium — UI feels slow during generation | Stream text first (appears instantly), images load progressively via SSE. Show skeleton loaders for images. |
| Image quality inconsistent across posts | Medium | Medium — breaks brand consistency | Review Agent specifically checks visual consistency. User can regenerate individual images. |
| Brand profile extraction inaccurate | Medium | Low — user can correct | All brand profile fields are editable. User overrides take priority over AI analysis. |
| Image preview models get deprecated | Low | High — breaks core feature | Use `gemini-2.5-flash` with `responseModalities`, not dedicated image preview models. Already using the stable path. |
| $100 credit budget exhausted | Low | Medium — can't generate more content | ~2,500 images on $100. Rate limit generation during dev. Reserve budget for demo recording. |
| Generated images contain text artifacts | Medium | Low — cosmetic issue | Prompt engineering to minimize text in images, or instruct model to generate clean product/lifestyle photos. |
| Video generation latency (Veo) | High | Medium — UI feels slow (2–3 min per clip) | Async generation with polling. User continues reviewing other posts while video generates. Progress indicator shows percentage. Video is a P1 add-on, not blocking the core image flow. |
| Video generation cost ($1.20–$3.20 per clip) | Medium | Medium — burns budget faster than images | Default to Veo 3.1 Fast ($1.20/clip). Budget tracker includes video costs. Cap at 3 videos per plan for dev/demo. Reserve $30 of $100 credit for video generation (~25 clips). |

## Post-Hackathon P2 Roadmap

P2 features sequenced by impact × effort. Grouped into sprints assuming 1–2 week cycles post-hackathon. SA should spec TDD sections in this order.

### Sprint 4 (Week 4): Export & Workflow — *highest impact, lowest effort*

These are the features that close the gap between "AI generates content" and "user actually posts content." Without them, Amplifi generates beautiful calendars that still require manual copy-paste workflows.

| Feature | Effort | Why Now |
|---|---|---|
| One-tap caption export | 3–4 hours | Copy-to-clipboard button on every caption. Also per-post image download and full-week ZIP export. Maria persona's #1 workflow request — without this, every caption requires manual highlight → copy → switch app → paste. Frontend-only. |
| Platform preview formatting | 1–2 days | Live preview of how each post appears on target platform: LinkedIn character count with "see more" fold, Instagram square crop, X truncation warning. Jason persona's key ask for LinkedIn-heavy content. Frontend components with real character limits. |
| Content editing/regeneration | 1–2 days | Edit individual captions inline. Regenerate a single post without regenerating the full week. Requires a new endpoint (`POST /api/content/{postId}/regenerate`) that calls Content Creator for one post with existing brand context. |
| Competitor visibility toggle | 2–3 hours | Show/hide toggle on competitor section of Brand Profile. Frontend-only. Maria finds competitor data stressful. Data still extracted (informs strategy), display is optional. |

**Sprint 4 total: ~3–4 days. Mostly frontend. One new endpoint.**

### Sprint 5 (Week 5–6): Brand Intelligence — *high impact, moderate effort*

These make the brand analysis smarter and the onboarding more flexible for different user types.

| Feature | Effort | Why Now |
|---|---|---|
| AI image quality validation | 4–6 hours | Quality confidence indicator on generated images. BYOP toggle prominence for high-risk industries (food, fashion, real estate). Brand Analyst flags industries where BYOP is recommended. Prompt change + frontend indicator. |
| Description-first onboarding option | 3–4 hours | A/B test inverting the URL-first flow — make description the default, URL the enhancement. For solopreneur-heavy audiences (coaches, consultants) who don't have websites. Frontend toggle + analytics event. |
| Visual identity seed | 1–2 days | Extract dominant colors, typography cues, and visual style from website/uploads. Generate an `image_style_directive` that's passed to every Content Creator image generation call. Ensures visual consistency across the week. Partially implemented in §3.2 — needs completion. |
| Multi-platform formatting | 1–2 days | Auto-adapt content for each platform's requirements: LinkedIn long-form vs X 280-char vs Instagram caption style. Strategy Agent already assigns platforms per post — this adds platform-specific Content Creator prompts per post. |

**Sprint 5 total: ~4–5 days. Prompt engineering + frontend.**

### Sprint 6 (Week 7–8): Analytics & Intelligence — *high impact, higher effort*

These require new data pipelines and integrations beyond the current Gemini-only stack.

| Feature | Effort | Why Now |
|---|---|---|
| Engagement prediction scoring | 3–5 days | Review Agent scores each post for predicted engagement. Requires calibration data (initially heuristic, later trained on actual post performance). Replaces static brand-consistency scoring with predictive scoring. |
| Existing social media voice analysis | 3–5 days | OAuth integrations for LinkedIn, X, Instagram APIs. Analyze user's existing posts to extract voice, successful patterns, audience preferences. Feeds into Brand Analyst. Major integration effort but transforms brand analysis accuracy. |
| Platform meta intelligence | 2–3 days | Crawl trending content per platform, analyze patterns, update Strategy Agent recommendations weekly. New data pipeline + tool on Strategy Agent. |
| Instagram grid visual consistency | 2–3 days | Style reference image generated during brand analysis, passed as visual context to every Content Creator call. Pixel-level consistency beyond prompt-level. |

**Sprint 6 total: ~1.5–2 weeks. New integrations + data pipelines.**

### Sprint 7+ (Month 2+): Stretch Features

| Feature | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Video repurposing / smart editing | 1–2 weeks | User uploads raw video → AI auto-captions, extracts highlights, adapts to platform formats. Separate pipeline from Veo generation. New agent required. |
| Industry-adaptive demo content (P3) | 2–3 days | Personalize sample content during onboarding to match user's inferred industry. Leadership coach sees LinkedIn posts, not farm-to-table captions. Prompt change + sample generation during Brand Analyst phase. |
| Post analytics dashboard (P3) | 2–3 weeks | Connect to social media APIs to track actual post performance. Close the feedback loop: which AI-generated posts performed best? Requires OAuth + analytics pipeline + dashboard UI. |

# Appendix: Interleaved Output Constraints

| Constraint | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Image generation takes several seconds per image | UI feels slow | Stream text first, images load progressively. Skeleton loaders. |
| ~$0.039 per image (~1,290 tokens) | Budget: ~2,500 images on $100 credit | Plenty for development + demo. Rate limit during dev. |
| 1024×1024 max image resolution | Social platforms need various sizes | Generate at 1024×1024, resize client-side per platform spec. |
| Interleaved output NOT available in Live API | Can't combine voice + image generation | Use standard `generateContent` API for content. Add Live API separately for optional voice coaching. |
| `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` has been shut down | Must use correct model | Use `gemini-2.5-flash` with `responseModalities: ["TEXT", "IMAGE"]`. This is the supported path. |
| Image output may include unwanted text overlays | Generated images sometimes contain text artifacts | Prompt engineering: "Generate a clean product photo without text overlays." Review Agent catches issues. |
