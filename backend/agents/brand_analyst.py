    prompt = f"""You are a brand strategist analyzing a business to build a comprehensive brand profile for social media content creation.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION: {description}
{website_context}{social_voice_context}

Infer the business type and tailor your analysis:
- local_business: local/physical businesses (restaurants, salons, gyms, shops)
- service: consulting, coaching, agencies, professional services
- personal_brand: solopreneurs, creators, influencers, coaches with personal name brands
- ecommerce: online stores, DTC brands, product-focused businesses

Analyze the provided information and extract:

1. BUSINESS_NAME: The brand/business name (infer from description if needed)
2. BUSINESS_TYPE: One of: local_business, service, personal_brand, ecommerce
3. INDUSTRY: The industry category (e.g., "Food & Beverage", "Fitness & Wellness", "B2B Software")
4. TONE: 3-5 comma-separated adjectives describing brand voice (e.g., "warm, approachable, artisanal")
5. COLORS: Array of 3 hex colors [primary, secondary, accent] that represent the brand
6. TARGET_AUDIENCE: One sentence describing demographics and psychographics
7. VISUAL_STYLE: One sentence describing photography/visual aesthetic style
8. CONTENT_THEMES: Array of 5-8 content topics this brand should post about
9. COMPETITORS: Array of 2-3 competitor names or domains
10. IMAGE_STYLE_DIRECTIVE: A 2-3 sentence visual identity fragment. Be EXTREMELY specific about colors, lighting, composition, textures. This will be prepended to every image generation prompt.
    BAD: "professional and clean"
    GOOD: "warm earth tones with terracotta and sage green accents, soft natural lighting with golden hour warmth, minimalist compositions with generous whitespace, organic textures like linen and raw wood, shot from slightly above at 30-degree angle"
11. CAPTION_STYLE_DIRECTIVE: A 2-4 sentence writing rhythm guide. Describe structural patterns, not just adjectives.
    BAD: "professional and friendly"
    GOOD: "Open with a one-sentence hook under 10 words. Second beat is a personal anecdote or concrete example. Third beat delivers the counterintuitive insight or actionable takeaway. Close with a direct question to drive comments. Use em dashes liberally. Never use exclamation marks."
12. IMAGE_GENERATION_RISK: Assess the risk of AI-generated images for this business type:
    - "high": food photography, fashion, real estate, jewelry, automotive, cosmetics, restaurants — industries where bad AI images are worse than no images. Authenticity is critical.
    - "medium": fitness, travel, education, events — AI images acceptable but user photos are strongly preferred for authenticity.
    - "low": SaaS, consulting, coaching, finance, tech — abstract/graphic/conceptual images work well for AI generation.
13. BYOP_RECOMMENDATION: A concise 1-2 sentence recommendation explaining whether they should use their own photos.
    For "high" risk: strongly recommend using real photos with an industry-specific reason.
    For "medium": gently suggest that real photos improve engagement.
    For "low": confirm that AI-generated images work great for their content type.
