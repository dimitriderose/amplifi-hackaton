# ✨ Amplifi

**Your AI creative director. One brand. Infinite content.**

An AI-powered creative director that analyzes your brand and produces complete, ready-to-post social media content packages — captions, images, hashtags, and posting schedules — all generated together in a single interleaved output stream.

## What is this?

Amplifi uses Gemini's interleaved text + image output to generate copy and visuals together in one coherent stream. Paste your website URL (or just describe your business), and get a full week of social media content tailored to your brand, across every platform.

- 🎨 **Brand-aware AI** — extracts your colors, tone, audience, and style automatically
- 📅 **Full weekly calendar** — 7 days of content with pillar-based strategy
- 🖼️ **Interleaved generation** — captions and matching images born together
- 📱 **Multi-platform** — Instagram, LinkedIn, X, TikTok, Facebook
- 📸 **Bring your own photos** — upload product shots, get tailored captions
- 🎬 **AI video** — generate Reels/TikTok clips via Veo

## How it works

1. **Paste your URL** — Amplifi crawls your site and extracts your brand DNA. No website? Just describe your business.
2. **AI builds your brand** — Colors, tone, audience, competitors, style directives — all editable.
3. **Get your week** — Watch as a 7-day content calendar streams in live, post by post.
